<h2><u>Overview:</u><h2>
<h4>Book•Smart allows users to search for books and view both current and historical bestseller data from <em>The New York Times</em>.  This web application was designed for book lovers who want to find more information about specific titles, and their respective bestseller history (or lack thereof). Our final product allows the user to search for any book and returns an interactive gallery of titles with the ability to fetch more information about selected titles. Additional features include the ability to see current bestsellers from <em>The New York Times</em>, as well as viewing bestsellers on dates specified by the user. In the future, we would like to incorporate a backend server and database, which will allow the user to create a profile, login, and keep track of books they're interested in or have read. We would also like to implement other APIs which will allow the user to see reviews, and be recommended similar titles (i.e. Goodreads, etc.).</h4>
